# Assets

## Profile photo

Add your profile photo here so it appears in the navbar and on the home page hero.

1. Save your image as **`profile.jpg`** in this folder (`assets/profile.jpg`).
2. Recommended: square image, at least 400×400 px (e.g. from LinkedIn: download your profile picture and rename it to `profile.jpg`).

If `profile.jpg` is missing, the site will show your initials **AP** instead.

## Certification logos (`certs/`)

The Experience page uses logo images for each certification card. Current files:

- **`togaf.svg`** – TOGAF / Open Group
- **`aws.svg`** – AWS Certified
- **`microsoft-ai.svg`** – Microsoft Agentic AI

You can replace these with official badge images (e.g. from Credly or issuer sites) by keeping the same filenames or updating the `src` in `experience.html`.
